# 🎯 Design Patterns: 80/20 Rule Guide

This guide focuses on the most **practical and commonly used design patterns** — covering **Creational**, **Structural**, and **Behavioral** categories.

## 🔨 Creational Design Patterns

These patterns deal with **object creation** — they abstract or manage how instances are constructed.

### ✅ Must-Know (Top 3)

| Pattern       | Purpose                                | Real-World Use Case                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Builder**   | Builds complex objects step-by-step    | Fluent APIs, JSON builders, query builders |
| **Factory**   | Delegates object creation to a factory | Database drivers, plugin loading           |
| **Singleton** | One instance globally                  | Config manager, DB connection pool         |

## 🧱 Structural Design Patterns

These patterns define how objects/classes are **composed** to form larger structures.

| Pattern       | Purpose                              | Real-World Use Case                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Integrates incompatible interfaces   | Legacy service integration, SDK bridges     |
| **Decorator** | Adds features to objects dynamically | Logging middleware, UI theming, auth layers |
| **Facade**    | Simplifies complex subsystems        | Home theater system, third-party wrappers   |

## 🎭 Behavioral Design Patterns

These patterns deal with **object interaction and responsibility** — how behavior is delegated or changed dynamically.

| Pattern      | Purpose                                               | Real-World Use Case                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Strategy** | Select algorithms/behavior at runtime                 | Payment processor, sorting strategies    |
| **Observer** | Event subscription and notification                   | Pub/Sub, GUI listeners, reactive systems |
| **Command**  | Encapsulate operations as objects                     | Undo/redo, task queues, job runners      |
| **State**    | Change behavior based on internal state               | Vending machines, workflow engines       |
| **Iterator** | Sequential access without exposing internal structure | File readers, cursor-based DB fetches    |

## 🧠 Tip

> 💡 **Don't try to learn all patterns at once.** Focus on these 11 patterns — they cover **80% of real-world needs**, both in codebases and system design interviews.

Happy building! 💪
